			<p>On the 15 June 1844  , Charles Goodyear     patented a chemical process for converting latex from a rubber   tree into a more durable material by mixing it with sulphur and white lead and by heating this compund to a certain temperature. To honour the man and his invention, a tyre factory was named after him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodyear may have invented the process of vulcanization, but he wasnt the first to produce durable rubber. Thousands of years before him, Mesoamerican civilization knew that if you mixed latex with the juice from morning glory vines, you got a substance  that is perfect for making sandels, bands

			<p>and, above all, balls. The oldest such  balls date from around 1600 BCE. They vary in size from a squash ball to a beach ball and were used for ceremonial ball games played on stone-walled courts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Christopher Columbus returned home after his second voyage to the New World, he brought some as a gift for King Charles V. Those who witnessed the balls being sent into the air after hitting the ground coudlnt believe their eyes. The elastic orb was nothing like the lifeless feather spheres filled with hair, feathers and air that they used to play early versions of tennis or football.

			<p>The incredible bounce was a result of Pre-Columbian chemistry. The Aztecs and Maya not only knew how to make rubber, but also had different recipes for different purposes. For bouncy balls they used a mixture with fifty percent juice. Sandals were made from 25 percent juice. And to acquire the strongest rubber bands, no juice was added. So more than 3400 years before Goodyear recieved U.S patent No. 3633 for his 'useful improvements', the Mesoamericans were successfully engineering materials to suit their needs.
